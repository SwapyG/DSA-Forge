# Day 1: Two Pointers Technique

## Problems Solved
1. **LeetCode 167 - Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted**
2. **LeetCode 125 - Valid Palindrome**
3. **LeetCode 344 - Reverse String**
4. **LeetCode 26 - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**
5. **LeetCode 977 - Squares of a Sorted Array**

## Technique Used
Two Pointers - efficient traversal using strategic pointer placement and movement.

## Pattern Variations Mastered
1. **Opposite Ends**: Pointers start at both ends, move toward center
2. **Same Direction**: Read/Write pointers moving at different speeds
3. **Building Results**: Using pointers to construct new arrays efficiently
4. **In-place Modification**: Direct array manipulation without extra space

## Applications Demonstrated
- **Finding pairs** in sorted arrays (Two Sum)
- **String validation** with character filtering (Palindrome)
- **Array/string reversal** (Reverse String)
- **Duplicate removal** with in-place modification (Remove Duplicates)
- **Result construction** from sorted data with negatives (Squares)
- **Single-pass efficient solutions** throughout

## Key Insights
1. **Sorted data advantage**: Make intelligent decisions about pointer movement
2. **Extreme values matter**: In negative arrays, largest squares at extremes
3. **Directional filling**: Sometimes build results backwards for efficiency
4. **Early termination**: Return immediately when goal is achieved
5. **Pointer semantics**: Read vs Write, Fast vs Slow, Building vs Modifying
